A small quality-of-life [Nexus](https://github.com/RaidcoreGG/NEXUS) addon for [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com/) that helps you keep track of your mouse during combat.  

Upon entering combat, the cursor switches to the game’s high- or low-contrast version, depending on your choice, and returns to normal once combat ends.


## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> You can install the addon directly through the in-game Nexus library with a single click.

If you prefer a manual install:

1. Download the latest [`combat_cursor.dll`](https://github.com/mriot/combat-cursor-releases/releases/latest/download/combat_cursor.dll)
2. Put the file into your Guild Wars 2 Nexus addons folder (e.g., `C:/Program Files/Guild Wars 2/addons`)  
3. Enable the addon in-game in Nexus

## Custom Cursors

While this addon does not directly support customization, it integrates very well with the [Custom Cursors](https://github.com/jordanrye/nexus-custom-cursors) addon.  
You can use it to replace the `high-contrast` cursor with any texture you choose, as shown below:

> Make sure to adjust the cursor’s hotspot accordingly.
