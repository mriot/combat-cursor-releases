A small quality-of-life [Nexus](https://github.com/RaidcoreGG/NEXUS) addon for [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com/) that helps you keep track of your mouse during combat.  

When you enter combat, the cursor switches to the game’s built-in high-contrast cursor and automatically reverts to normal once you're out.


## 📥 Installation

You can install the addon directly through the in-game Nexus library with a single click.

If you prefer a manual install:

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/mriot/combat-cursor-releases/releases) page  
2. Extract the files into your Guild Wars 2 Nexus addons folder (e.g., `C:/Games/Guild Wars 2/addons`)  
3. Enable the addon in Nexus
